<p>
</p>
I am a biologist with a broad interest in understanding how protein complexes are formed, and how such complexes build cells. 
<p>
</p>
For my PhD, I worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein" target="_blank">C-reactive protein</a>, a plasma protein that plays an important role in the innate immune response. My research primarly focused on the interactions of CRP with protein-lipid complexes & disorderd proteins. I also studied how CRP gene expression was regulated during inflammatory conditions.
<p>
</p>
After an extended career break, I am currently looking for new opportunities. If you think I might fit in your organisation, or just want to chat, please get in touch.
